# python_api_challenge

This project was to pull in data via API calls to Open Weather Map. The data is used to make weather analyses using Python from cities all of the world. The VacationPy portion is to find an ideal vacation spot. This project used SciPy, Matplotlib, Pandas, and Requests. Using GMaps for the VacationPy portion was fun.
